## Hardware
Amazon EC2 c4.4xlarge, High-CPU Extra Large Instance, with 62 EC2 Compute Units on 16 virtual cores of 8 physical CPUs.

# Part 1: Parallel Coin Flipping
## Analysis

1. Scaleup and speedup
+ Produce charts that show the scaleup and speedup of your program. Please Use line charts with correctly labelled axes and ticks. Do not use bar graphs or scatter plots.

+ Algorithm (true) speedup/scaleup measures the scaling performance of the algorithm as a function of processing elements. In this case, from 1..8. Characterize the algorithmic speedup/scaleup. If it is sub-linear, describe the potential sources of loss.

From 1 to 8 threads, the algorithmic speedup and scaleup are both sub-linear. The major reason is the overhead and communication in multiple threading. When the number of threads increases, more overhead is required to initialize all of them. Also, at the end of each thread, each thread needs to synchronize its individually calculated number of heads with the total number of heads. The more threads, the more time it will take to synchronize.


+ Why does the speedup not continue to increase past the number of cores? Does it degrade? Why?

From Fig.1, we can see that the speedup stops increasing after number of threads larger than 16. With 16 virtual cores, the maximum number of threads that can run at the same time is 16, then the additional threads will not get exucuted until one of the ongoing threads finishes. That means these additional threads are acting like serial code and cannot increase the speedup. In fact, it will degrade because for example, using 17 threads means one of the 16 cores need to run two threads each with $1/17$ of the task sequentially and it costs more time than each core running one thread with $1/16$ of the task.  Moreover, since more threads causes additional time to initialize and synchronize their results, the speedup will degrade after threads number gets larger than 16. 


1. Design and run an experiment that measures the startup costs of this code.

+ Describe your experiment. Why does it measure startup?

For the `CoinFlip.java` code, the startup cost mainly involves creating the array of Thread objects and initialize all threads, thus I seperated the `.start()` part from the initialization part and measured the startup cost by the following chunk of code.

```
long starttime = System.nanoTime();
// Array to hold references to thread objects
Thread[] threads = new Thread[numthreads];

// create and start specified thread objects of class SynchronizedWorks
for ( int i=0; i<numthreads; i++ )
{
    threads[i] = new Thread ( new CoinStartUp(i, numIter, numthreads) );
}
long headuptime = (System.nanoTime() - starttime)/1000;
```

For each number of threads from 1 to 16, the program runs 5 times. The results are summarized below.
